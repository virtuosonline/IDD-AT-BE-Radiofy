### Using the `radio-browser API`

- The extension uses the `Radio Browser API` to access a list of radio stations.
- Upon activating the extension, a request is sent to the API endpoint `https://de1.api.radio-browser.info/json/stations/search?limit=10000`, allowing the loading of a diverse range of radio stations into the extension interface.
- Results are displayed in such a way that users can click on a station name to listen to its live broadcast directly from the extension.
- Users can also perform a dynamic search as they type, filtering the list of stations in real time, enabling quick access to desired stations.

### Google Sheets & Apps Script
We used Google Apps Script to handle data storage and transmission seamlessly. This script acts as a bridge between the extension and the Google Sheets, allowing for easy data logging (e.g., heartbeat signals, user IDs) for analytics or monitoring purposes. To create a Google Apps Script:

1. Go to [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets).
2. Click on **Extensions**.
3. Click on **Apps Script**.
4. Copy the code we have on **GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT.js**
5. Deploy as Web App:
   - Click on "Deploy" -> "New deployment".
   - Choose "Web app" and set the access to "Anyone".
   - Deploy and note the URL provided; this is your webapp_url.
6. In config.json, replace the current webapp_url with your newly created Google Apps Script web app URL.

### User ID Generation
In `background.js`, we use `Date.now()` to generate a unique User ID when it doesn't already exist. This function returns the number of milliseconds elapsed since January 1, 1970, effectively creating a timestamp that is unique. Using this as part of the User ID ensures that even if multiple users install the extension at the same second, they will each receive a distinct ID. This helps with tracking user interactions without needing to implement complex identification systems.

### Installation for testing

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Load the extension in your browser:
   - Open the Extensions page in your browser (`about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`).
   - Click "Load Temporary Add-onâ€¦" and select the mainfest.json from extension folder.
3. The `d2dweather` search engine will be set as the default search engine after installation.

### Installation for regular users

1. Open Firefox browser.
2. Go to the [Firefox Add-ons page](https://addons.mozilla.org/).
3. Search for "d2dweather" in the search bar.
4. Click on the extension from the search results.
5. Click the "Add to Firefox" button.
6. Confirm the installation by clicking "Add" in the pop-up dialog.
7. Once installed, the `d2dweather` search engine will be set as the default search engine automatically.

## Changes to `config.json`

Update `config.json` to reflect the following structure:

```json
{
    "_commentForDomainName": "Update the parameter also in manifest.json",
    "domainName": "d2dweather", // Ensure spelling correction: "domianName" to "domainName"
    "_commentForHeartbeatTime": "Time in milliseconds",
    "sendHeartbeatTime": "6000",
    "_commentApi": "The Weather API",
    "weather_api": "YOUR_API", // Replace with your WeatherAPI key
    "_commentWebApp": "The Web App URL",
    "webapp_url": "YOUR_WEB_APP_URL" // Use the URL of your Google Apps Script web app
}
```
### Important Notes
- Replace `"YOUR_WEB_APP_URL"` with the URL of your deployed Google Apps Script.
- Ensure the domain name is correctly spelled as `"domainName"` in the JSON structure.
