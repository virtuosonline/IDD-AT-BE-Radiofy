### Using the `radio-browser API`

- The extension uses the `Radio Browser API` to access a list of radio stations.
- Upon activating the extension, a request is sent to the API endpoint `https://de1.api.radio-browser.info/json/stations/search?limit=10000`, allowing the loading of a diverse range of radio stations into the extension interface.
- Results are displayed in such a way that users can click on a station name to listen to its live broadcast directly from the extension.
- Users can also perform a dynamic search as they type, filtering the list of stations in real time, enabling quick access to desired stations.
